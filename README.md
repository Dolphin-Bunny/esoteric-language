# esoteric-language
An esoteric programming language I made. <br>
It has 9 commands you can use:
0 = nothing<br>
1 = jump to pointer if pointer is 0<br>
2 = increment value at location of pointer<br>
3 = decrement value at location of pointer<br>
4 = display character at location of pointer<br>
5 = stop execution<br>
6 = bring pointer to current execution location<br>
7 = read a character from stdin and save it to pointer location<br>
8 = move pointer back by one<br>
9 = swap position of pointer and execution location<br>
write your code in a file called `program` in the same folder as main.py, and run main.py<br>
I made this in like 20 minutes so it might have bugs<br>
contributions are welcome if you like this enough to make it better for whatever reason
